            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>
                I am a second year university student who has a strong passion for music, photography, and most
                importantly coding! I've been playing musical instruments since I was 4 years old, and I one of
                my favourite hobbies is travelling with my camera in hand. Most often though, I love getting lost 
                in code for hours, during which I play around with design or try to solve various algorithmic problems. 
                Moreover, I am an endlessly curious individual who loves learning and
                can be often found reading about nerdy topics such as particle physics or machine learning: you're
                never too cool to learn more about how our world works!

                    As part of the RBC summer student program, students were placed into teams of 3-15 people and 
                    tasked with the challenge of creating a solution that will help engage RBC summer students during
                    their coop term. After conducting interviews of current RBC summer students, our team found that one of
                    the main reasons why students were not as engaged during their work term was that they had a difficult time
                    connecting with people at the company. Thus, along with two other team memebers, I prototyped an application
                    that allows students to connect with other students at RBC by matching users based on both professional and
                    personal interests. By connecting students with likeminded individuals, my team hopes to encourage students
                    to come out to more RBC events, and to give these students a way to share and talk about their own experiences
                    with individuals who are going through similar ones.

                    Nearly one million Canadian children start school on an empty stomach due to a lack of 
                    access to nutritious food, which has been shown to increase risk of developing chronic 
                    illnesses, mental health problems and poor academic performance. Vittles is an organization 
                    that operates under the belief that everyone has the fundamental right to nutrition and 
                    consequently, aims to address this injustice. During the day, Vittles operates as a casual 
                    restaurant that provides carefully crafted, made-to-order, healthy meals and at the end of 
                    each operating day, packages its food surplus to send to local schools to tackle this 
                    inequality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In collaboaration with 4 other students, we worked to build Vittles from the ground up: starting
                    with an initial business proposition, continuing to market research and the creation of a value
                    proposition canvas, solidifying a sound business model, and finally, in pitching this venture 
                    to a panel of judges posing as potential investors. If you would like to learn more about
                    Vittles, you can find our presentation deck <a href="Vittles-Final-Presentation/vittles.html">here</a>.
